##CM3D Extrusor MINI + FS

This extruder use a dual gear drive and you will be able to integrate the FS  in the extruder body, similar to the IFS extruder. We have added three variants for PC4-M6, M8 and M10. 

The filament path is now clean and straight.

Fully compatible with the last firmware of PRUSA MINI+, you will need to change the following settings:

    Extruder steps must be set to 415
    Extruder direction must be set to “wrong” as PRUSA has named.

The external appearance for the M8 and M10 version are under development but are fully functional by now.

If you need some kind of support we a have a telegram group for that purpose
