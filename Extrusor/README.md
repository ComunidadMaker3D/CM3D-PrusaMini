##CM3D Extrusor MINI + FS

This extruder use a dual gear drive and you will be able to integrate the FS  in the extruder body, similar to the IFS extruder. We have added three variants for PC4-M6, M8 and M10. 

The filament path is now clean and straight.

Fully compatible with the last firmware of PRUSA MINI+, you will need to change the following settings:

    Extruder steps must be set to 415
    Extruder direction must be set to “wrong” as PRUSA has named.

The external appearance for the M8 and M10 version are under development but are fully functional by now.

In order to assembly it you will need:

    5 M3x40mm screws
    3 M3x10mm screw
    1 complete dual gear kit 

In case that the magnets had any kind of movement inside the holes you can use a little piece of paper in order to tight the magnets.
